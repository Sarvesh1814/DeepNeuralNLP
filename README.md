# DeepNeuralNLP

Welcome to the DeepNeuralNLP repository! This repository is dedicated to our Master's course IT555: Deep Neural NLP, taught by Professor Sourish Das Gupta, where we explore various aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using deep learning techniques. Each branch in this repository represents a single assignment, which will eventually come together to form our final project.

**Course Instructor: Prof. Sourishdas Gupta**
